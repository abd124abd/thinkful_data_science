Hurricane Analysis

Category 5, the strongest hurricane classification, defined by sustained wind speeds equal to or greater than 252 km/h.  That is strong enough to blow over most types of buildings located within a few miles of the coast.  In 1998, Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 hurricane, swept through Central America, the Yucatan Peninsula and South Florida, leaving in its trali a death toll reaching upwards of 19,000 people.  Recent changes in climate are indicating the potential for even stronger storms to come.  Could a 6th, or even 7th Category be added to the scale?  A Category 6 hurricane would bring sustained wind speeds in excess of 290km/h - 314km/h.  At those speeds, catastrophic failures to man-made structures are almost inevitable, regardless of the extent of the engineering.  

Are the hurricanes of today changing, evolving from their ancestors, and if so, how?  Are they becoming more prevalent - stronger - changing in their location of onset?  Exploring answers to these questions will help us start to shed light on what could be in store for the Earth and its inhabitants as changes in climate continue to influence the characteristics and behaviors of storms.

Since 1851 - there have been 2864 recorded hurricanes, 1814 over the Atlantic (1851-2015), and 1050 over the Pacific (1949-2015).  In 2015, there were roughly 3 hurricanes for every 2 that occurred since record-keeping began.  Hurricanes over the Atlantic are over 2.5x more likely now than they were in 1851.  Over the Pacific, 3x as likely than 1949.  Hurricanes are becoming more frequent, both over the Atlantic as well as the Pacific.

Hurricanes also appear to be moving.  The storms take place over and around the Americas.  Over the last 165 years, Hurricanes over the Atlantic ocean start taking place further to the West, closer to the tip of Florida on average, than the mid-1800’s, where they were taking place further out into sea.  Similarly, Hurricanes over the Pacific Ocean have been moving away from the continent and West out to the sea.

The images above were produced by considering the average location of storms on each of the initial and final years of the data.  The plot might look different if we considered the location changes on each of the year in between.  As such, this might not be accurate.  In fact, when we look at the directional changes of the storms over the years, we see that they are in fact moving in all directions, without a readily apparent and consistent path.

Deeper analysis would be required to obtain a clearer and more accurate representation of how Hurricane onset locations are changing over time.	Interestingly, and contrary to what might be assumed, the storms appear to be weakening over time.  The average wind speeds of the storms are dropping, both over the Atlantic and the Pacific.

Even if we accept maximum wind speeds be representative of Hurricane strength, this data includes many types of tropical storms, not only Hurricanes. What we could be seeing is an increase in tropical storm recordings which are too weak to receive a Hurricane designation.  Further analysis could consider other factors which relate a storm’s strength as well as ensure only those storms which qualify as Hurricane status are measured.
	
Another glance at the data shows that the average of the average maximum wind speed readings does not even qualify for Category 1 Hurricane status.  While this might seem like most of the readings considered were not Hurricane’s at all, but lesser tropical storms , it should be noted that these are average readings, and there is an inconsistent number of readings for each Hurricane.  Non-Hurricane storms could have more readings per hurricane, thus skewing the results.

So, are Hurricanes changing?  At a glance, Hurricanes do appear to be occurring more frequently, over both the Atlantic as well as the Pacific.  Further analysis could better define strom strength, more accurately and deeply assess storm onset location changes, and account for the variety of storm statuses.  Cross-analysis with climate change data would allow for stronger correlations and support.  As for whether a Category 6 Hurricane classification will be required one day, this remains to be seen.  At the time of writing, several storms are coming to life at a relatively late stage in the season.  It does appear storms are changing in significant ways.
